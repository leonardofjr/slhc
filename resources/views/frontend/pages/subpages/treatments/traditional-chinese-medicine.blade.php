<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine is a holistic, natural health care system that dates back thousands of years old ( 2,000 years to the year 200 B.C.) Traditional Chinese Medicine also known as TCM is “holistic” and “natural” because it stimulates the body’s own healing mechanisms and takes into account all aspects of a patient’s life, rather than just several obvious signs or symptoms.</p>

<p>A TCM practitioners view the body as a complex network of interconnected parts (part of a larger concept known as Qi), rather than separate systems or organs.</p>

<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine aim to correct imbalances in the body and primarily work in three major ways:</p>

<ul>

    <li>Addressing a patient’s external factors and environment</li>

<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine draws on the belief that Qi (which roughly translates to “vital energy” and is pronounced “chee”) is essential for overall health.</p>



<ul>

<li>Qi is said to circulate throughout the body along pathways called meridians, and proper Qi is needed to keep all systems in balance.</li>

<li>Meridians are utilized in many TCM practices, including acupuncture and&nbsp;acupressure, which focus on treating specific meridian points throughout the body that can be located anywhere from the&nbsp;head to the soles of our feet.</li>

<li>Meridians are believed to be connected to specific organ systems, and therefore focusing on certain meridians helps resolve specific symptoms. According to TCM, restoring Qi can be beneficial for preventing diseases from developing and treating existing inflammation,&nbsp;injuries, pain or illnesses.</li>

</ul>



<p>Another concept that’s vital to Traditional Chinese Medicine is yin and yang, defined as opposing but complementary energies. You might be familiar with the yin-yang symbol (a circle that’s half white and half black with smaller circles inside), which is used to represent the concept of all of earth’s opposing forces, including hot and cold, winter and summer, energy and rest. It is believed that, like Qi, yin and yang negatively affect your health when they’re out of balance and one is more dominant than the other, so a primary goal of TCM treatment is to restore their equalizing relationship.</p>



<h2>Who can benefit most from Chinese herbs?</h2>

<ul>

<li>Chinese herbs focus on helping correct dysfunction of certain organs and unhealthy body patterns. The goal of herbal therapy is to bring the body back into a state of&nbsp;homeostasis&nbsp;(balance) and restore proper energy (also called Qi).</li>

<li>Patients with many different symptoms can be treated with herbs, including those with frequent colds or the flu, fatigue, chronic respiratory issues, infertility, allergies, chronic pain, anxiety or depression, trouble sleeping,&nbsp;menopausal symptoms&nbsp;and even people recovering from cancer or chemotherapy.</li>

<li>Some scenarios that make a patient a good candidate for herbal therapy include having more than one unexplained symptom, feeling fatigued on top of having other symptoms, not responding well to medications or experiencing side effects, feeling anxious&nbsp;or depressed, in addition to having other symptoms.</li>
