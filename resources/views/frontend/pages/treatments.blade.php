               <h3>Traditional Chinese Medicine</h3>
               <p>Traditional Chinese Medicine is a holistic, natural health care system that dates back thousands of years old ( 2,000 years to the year 200 B.C.) Traditional Chinese Medicine also known as TCM is “holistic” and “natural” because it stimulates the body’s own healing mechanisms and takes into account all aspects of a patient’s life, rather than just several obvious signs or symptoms.</p>
